## Introduction - Message Board (Forum) Application (Front-End)

This is a simple front-end Message Board application that was developed for the purpose of consuming data from a Web Services project.

In my Web Services class at Camosun College, I had to design and build a Web Service for a Message Board Application. The Message Board App is a great concept for learning to build an API because we can incorporate all the database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations. We will be creating messages, updating them, and deleting them.
